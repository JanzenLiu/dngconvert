Install instructions for MacOSX


A. Prerequisites

1. Install MacPorts (http://www.macports.org/install.php)

2. Install Libjpeg and Exiv2 library via MacPorts:

 port install exiv2 jpeg


B. Build LibRaw

1. Download and extract LibRAW (http://www.libraw.org/)
   Note: You don't need LibRAW demosaic packs

2. Configure and build LibRAW (installing the library is optional):

 ./configure --disable-lcms --disable-shared
 make

3. Set path to static library:

 LIBRAW_PATH=${PWD}


C. Building dngconvert

1. In the dngconvert directory create a build subdir and run cmake:

 mkdir build
 cd build
 CXXFLAGS="-O2" CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=$LIBRAW_PATH \
 CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=${LIBRAW_PATH}/lib cmake ..

2. If cmake complains it cannot find libexiv2 or libjpeg add
   /opt/local/include to CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH and /opt/local/lib to
   CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH

3. Then compile dngconvert:

 make
